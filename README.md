# Wallcanvas
Pygame canvas for the displaywall. 

# How to 
See example.py on how to use the wallcanvas. Note that client.py must
run on all the tiles before starting your visualization. 

# Application: pivis
First application that uses the wallcanvas system. It visualizes the first n
digits of pi. Inspired by Martin Krzywinskis posters at 
http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/piday/.
